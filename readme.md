## WorkShop Buddy
App is hosted here - https://workshopbuddy.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction
A joint project with my classmates, Ken Wong & Dave Li. Made using React & Express. This app enables users to keep track of their vehicle maintainance records, make appointments with workshops.
It also enables workshops to accept appointments, keep records of their customers and vehicle service history, to enable easier rectification of problems.

## TechStack

## Features
- User is able to input a vehicle
- User is able to make appointments. And await for appointment confirmation
